# üè• Verify Health Influencers Admin Panel

Welcome to the "Verify Influencers" Admin Panel project! This README will guide you through the solution to the challenge of verifying health claims made by popular influencers. Our goal is to bring clarity and credibility to online health information by leveraging AI and credible scientific research.

## üöÄ Project Overview

### Problem Statement

With the abundance of health advice from various "experts" online, it can be challenging to discern trustworthy information. Our platform aims to verify health claims from influencers using credible scientific research, making it easier for people to find honest, evidence-based guidance.

### Solution

The admin panel automatically:

1. **Discovers and Analyzes Content**: Pulls recent health-related tweets and podcast transcripts for a given influencer.
2. **Identifies Health Claims**: Extracts health claims from the content and categorizes them.
3. **Verifies Claims**: Cross-references claims against reliable journals and assigns a verification status and trust score.
4. **Displays Results**: Presents the results in a clean, user-friendly interface.
